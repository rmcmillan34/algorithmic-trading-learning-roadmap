# Probabilistic Models and Inference

## Overview
Probabilistic Models and Inference explore the use of probability theory to model and reason about uncertain systems. This module focuses on probabilistic graphical models, inference techniques, and their applications in algorithmic trading, enabling learners to make data-driven decisions under uncertainty.

## Prerequisites
- Probability and Statistics.
- Basic Linear Algebra and Calculus.
- Familiarity with Machine Learning concepts.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:
- Understand the theory and construction of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs).
- Perform inference on Bayesian networks and Markov networks.
- Learn probabilistic reasoning and apply it to financial datasets.
- Implement algorithms for parameter estimation and structure learning in PGMs.

## Key Concepts
- **Bayesian Networks**: Directed graphical models for representing conditional dependencies.
- **Markov Networks**: Undirected graphical models for representing joint probability distributions.
- **Exact Inference**: Variable elimination, belief propagation, and junction trees.
- **Approximate Inference**: Monte Carlo methods, variational inference, and sampling techniques.
- **Structure Learning**: Techniques for learning the structure of PGMs from data.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading
- **Risk Modeling**: Use Bayesian inference to model market uncertainty and risk factors.
- **Volatility Prediction**: Apply probabilistic models to forecast financial volatility.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Leverage PGMs to optimize asset allocations under uncertainty.
- **Event Detection**: Detect and model significant market events using probabilistic reasoning.
