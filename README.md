## Purpose
After deciding that I wanted to undertake the enormous task of becoming an algorithmic trader, I noticed there was a lot of information across many domains that I would need to master. I learn best when I have a list of things that I need to learn. The purpose of this repository is to provide my self-paced, modular curated learning template and resources to help other aspiring algorithmic traders build proficiency in:

- Artificial Intelligence: Applying machine learning techniques to create predictive models for trading.
- Algorithmic Trading: Developing, testing, and optimizing trading algorithms.
- Cloud & DevOps: Deploying scalable trading algorithms on cloud platforms with CI/CD pipelines.
- Data Science: Analyzing, processing, and interpreting large datasets to make data-driven decisions.
- Finance: Understanding financial markets, instruments, and quantitative finance principles.
- Mathematics: Applying mathematical principles such as probability, statistics, and calculus in financial modelling.
- General Skills: Technical Writing, Databases, Project management, and more.
- Software Engineering: Writing clean, efficient code and following best practices for project deployment and version control.

This repository is designed to be used as a local repository, to organise resources, and learning materials, adaptable for individual use or collaboration, and suitable for any level of experience.

## Repository Structure
Each branch in this repository is dedicated to a specific knowledge area. Branches contain references to:

- Curated Resources: Articles, tutorials, course and book recommendations.
- Certifications: Suggested industry-recognized certifications to validate your knowledge.
- Projects: Practical project suggestions to apply concepts and build a portfolio.

## Usage Guide
Select a Topic: Start with the topic area that aligns best with your current lack of knowledge or an interest area (e.g., Data Science, Finance).
Follow the Roadmap: Each branch contains a progressive list of topics. Start from the basics and work through each section, aiming to complete recommended certifications and projects.
Build Projects: Apply your newly gained skills to projects recommended within each subject. 
Document Your Progress: Use a note-taking application such as Obsidian or a Trello board to keep track of completed courses, certifications, and projects.
Collaborate and Share: Share your progress and insights with the community. Open pull requests to suggest new resources or improvements.
