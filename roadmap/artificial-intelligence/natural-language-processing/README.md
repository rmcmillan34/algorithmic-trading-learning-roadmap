# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This module delves into techniques for processing and analyzing textual data, enabling learners to extract actionable insights from financial news, earnings calls, and social media sentiment for algorithmic trading.

---

## Prerequisites
- Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning).
- Python Programming with experience in text processing libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy`.
- Familiarity with deep learning concepts (e.g., embeddings, sequence models).

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:
- Understand the foundational concepts and models of NLP.
- Implement text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.
- Apply sequence models and attention mechanisms to financial text data.
- Leverage advanced NLP models for tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and cleaning.
- **Vector Representations**: Word embeddings, TF-IDF, and neural embeddings.
- **Sequence Modeling**: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and transformers.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Self-attention, context-aware embeddings, and transformer architectures.
- **NLP Applications in Finance**: Sentiment analysis, earnings call analysis, and topic modeling.

---

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate market sentiment from news or social media.
- **Topic Modeling**: Extract key themes from large volumes of financial text.
- **Event Detection**: Identify actionable insights from financial reports and earnings calls.
- **Natural Language Generation**: Summarize financial documents and create trading signals.
