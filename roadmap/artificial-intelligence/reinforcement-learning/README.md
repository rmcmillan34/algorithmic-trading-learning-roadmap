# Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment. This module explores RL techniques, such as value-based and policy-based methods, and their applications in algorithmic trading, enabling learners to design dynamic trading strategies and optimize portfolio management.

## Prerequisites
- Machine Learning, particularly supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Basic Probability, Linear Algebra, and Calculus.
- Familiarity with Python and deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, including agents, actions, rewards, and environments.
- Implement value-based and policy-based methods for training RL agents.
- Explore advanced RL techniques, such as function approximation and deep reinforcement learning.
- Apply RL algorithms to financial applications, including trading strategy optimization and portfolio management.

## Key Concepts
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Value-Based Methods**: Q-learning, SARSA, and deep Q-networks (DQNs).
- **Policy-Based Methods**: Policy gradients, actor-critic methods, and advanced techniques like PPO.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Strategies to balance learning new behaviors versus leveraging known rewards.
- **Function Approximation**: Neural networks and deep RL for scaling to large state and action spaces.
