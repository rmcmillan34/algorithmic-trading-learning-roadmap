# C++

## Overview

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used in system/software development, game development, real-time simulations, and financial systems. Its efficiency and control over system resources make it a preferred choice for applications where performance is critical.

In the context of artificial intelligence and algorithmic trading, C++ is instrumental in developing low-latency trading systems, implementing performance-critical algorithms, and interfacing with hardware or high-frequency trading platforms.
