# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” — data structures that encapsulate both state and behavior. OOP promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code by enforcing principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

It is a dominant model in modern programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java, C#, Ruby) and is widely used in software development, simulation, game development, system design, and application-level architecture.

In the context of algorithmic trading and AI, OOP enables clean abstraction of trading strategies, market agents, and reusable system components.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with at least one programming language
- Understanding of basic control flow (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Optional: experience with procedural or functional programming

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:

- Understand and implement core OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)
- Write modular and extensible object-oriented code
- Differentiate between class-based and prototype-based object systems
- Apply OOP idioms in Python, C++, or Java
- Understand constructor/destructor patterns and memory ownership (C++)
- Refactor procedural code into object-oriented codebases
- Apply SOLID principles to structure scalable OOP systems

---

## Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation** – Bundling data and methods, access control (private/protected/public)
- **Inheritance** – Code reuse via subclassing; hierarchical relationships
- **Polymorphism** – Method overriding and dynamic dispatch
- **Abstraction** – Interface definition and separation of concerns
- **Composition vs Inheritance** – Favoring reusable object composition
- **Constructors/Destructors** – Object lifecycle control (C++, Python `__init__`)
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes** – Blueprinting behavior
- **Operator Overloading** – Custom behavior for language primitives
- **Class vs Object** – Instance relationships, static methods, and memory layout

---

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

- **Strategy Abstraction** – Defining reusable strategy classes with polymorphic behavior
- **Order Management** – Object-oriented models of trade orders and portfolio positions
- **Modular System Components** – Swappable loggers, data providers, and brokers using interfaces
- **Simulation Agents** – Market actors with behavior encapsulated in class hierarchies
- **Event-Driven Design** – Object handling of signals, messages, and actions

## FAQs

**Q: Is OOP still relevant in modern development?**  
A: Yes — while alternatives like functional or data-oriented programming are growing, OOP remains dominant in many domains, especially business logic and GUI-heavy applications.

**Q: What are SOLID principles?**  
A: A set of five best practices for writing clean, maintainable object-oriented code: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

**Q: What’s the difference between a class and an object?**  
A: A class defines structure and behavior; an object is a specific instance of that class in memory.
