# Python

## Overview

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in fields such as web development, data science, automation, AI/ML, cybersecurity, finance, and academic research.

This section covers Python syntax, standard libraries, best practices, and core programming idioms. It provides resources to take you from beginner scripting to building production-grade systems.

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (variables, loops, conditionals)
- No prior Python experience required

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:

- Write and execute Python scripts across versions (3.x focus)
- Use Python data types, control flow, functions, and modules
- Work with file systems, networking, and command-line tools
- Apply object-oriented and functional patterns in Python
- Understand Python memory model and execution environment
- Leverage the Python ecosystem via `pip`, virtual environments, and libraries
- Write idiomatic, clean, and testable Python code

---

## Key Concepts

- **Python Syntax and Semantics** – Indentation, dynamic typing, expressions
- **Built-in Data Types** – `str`, `int`, `list`, `dict`, `set`, `tuple`
- **Control Flow** – Conditionals, loops, comprehensions, context managers
- **Functions and Scope** – First-class functions, closures, decorators
- **Object-Oriented Features** – Classes, inheritance, dunder methods, `__slots__`
- **Functional Patterns** – `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, iterators
- **Modules and Packages** – `import`, `__init__.py`, structure
- **Error Handling** – `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`
- **Tooling and Workflow** – `pip`, `venv`, `poetry`, linters, formatters

---

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

- **Data Retrieval and Parsing** – APIs, JSON, XML, Pandas
- **Strategy Scripting and Backtesting** – Clean implementation using OOP or functional models
- **Automation and Reporting** – Scripts for trade logging, alerts, or batch jobs
- **Integration** – REST clients, websocket feeds, FIX wrappers
- **Rapid Prototyping** – Use notebooks or scripts to explore market hypotheses

## FAQs

**Q: What version of Python should I learn?**  
A: Learn Python 3.11+ (the latest stable). Python 2 is no longer supported.

**Q: How do I structure a Python project?**  
A: Use a virtual environment, split code into modules, use a `main.py` or CLI entry point, and include tests in `/tests`.

**Q: Can I use Python for production trading systems?**  
A: Yes, for scripting, modeling, and automation. Use C++/Rust for latency-sensitive components and call them from Python.
