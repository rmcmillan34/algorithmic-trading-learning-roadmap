# Theory of Computation

## Overview

Theory of Computation explores the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers. It defines what problems can be solved (computability) and how efficiently they can be solved (complexity).

While not directly used in most algorithmic trading systems, these theoretical foundations underpin modern algorithms, compiler design, cryptography, and complexity-aware design patterns. This topic is **optional** for most developers but **essential** for those who want a deep understanding of computer science.
