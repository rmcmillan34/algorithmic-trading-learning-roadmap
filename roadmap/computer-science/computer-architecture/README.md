# Computer Architecture

## Overview

Computer Architecture is the study of how computers are structured and how their components interact ‚Äî from logic gates and ALUs to instruction sets, memory hierarchies, and pipelines. Understanding architecture builds your mental model for performance, memory, and instruction-level execution, which can be crucial when optimizing code or building low-level systems.

While this topic is **optional** for most algorithmic trading workflows, it's **foundational for systems engineering** and **hugely helpful** for those working with C/C++, performance tuning, embedded systems, or building low-level libraries.
