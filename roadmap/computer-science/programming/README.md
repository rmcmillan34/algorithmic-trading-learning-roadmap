## FAQs

**Q: What’s the difference between programming and software engineering?**  
A: Programming is writing code; software engineering is designing, testing, and maintaining systems that scale and last.

**Q: Is it bad to stick with one language?**  
A: Not at first. But over time, exploring different paradigms and language models will make you a stronger programmer.

**Q: What if I don’t like algorithms?**  
A: You don’t have to love them — but basic algorithmic thinking will help you write more efficient, reliable code.
