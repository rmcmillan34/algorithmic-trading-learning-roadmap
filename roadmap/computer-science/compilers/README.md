# Compilers

## Overview

Compilers are programs that translate code written in high-level languages (like C++, Python, or Java) into lower-level machine code or intermediate representations. Studying compilers reveals how programming languages are parsed, interpreted, optimized, and translated ‚Äî a cornerstone of systems programming and formal language theory.

This topic is **optional** for most algorithmic trading workflows but highly valuable for those who want to understand performance optimization, custom DSL design, or build interpreters and transpilers.
