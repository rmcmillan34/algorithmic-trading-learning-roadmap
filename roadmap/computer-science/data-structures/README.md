# Data Structures

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental building blocks of efficient algorithms and programs. They define how data is organized, accessed, and manipulated in memory. A strong understanding of data structures allows developers to optimize performance, solve problems effectively, and write scalable code â€” all critical for algorithmic trading.

This topic is **mandatory** for most software engineers and quantitative developers.

## Status: ðŸŸ¢ Mandatory

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| âœ… Every programmer, regardless of specialization |
| âœ… Especially important for anyone working with algorithms, trading logic, or backtesting |
| âœ… Core to technical interviews and performance-critical code |

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, learners will be able to:

- Understand how core data structures work internally and in the standard libraries
- Choose the appropriate structure based on time/space complexity
- Analyze and implement classic structures such as stacks, queues, trees, and graphs
- Write efficient code for searching, sorting, caching, and storage
- Use built-in and custom structures in Python and C++

---

## Key Concepts

- **Arrays / Lists** â€“ Fixed vs dynamic, indexing, memory layout
- **Stacks / Queues / Deques** â€“ LIFO/FIFO logic, circular buffers
- **Hash Tables / Dictionaries / Maps** â€“ Hashing, collisions, performance
- **Trees** â€“ Binary trees, BSTs, AVL, heaps, segment trees
- **Graphs** â€“ Adjacency matrix/list, DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, Union-Find
- **Tries** â€“ Prefix trees for text-based queries or tickers
- **Linked Lists** â€“ Singly, doubly, skip lists
- **Sets** â€“ Unique collections with fast lookup
- **Priority Queues / Heaps** â€“ Scheduling, task management, order books
- **Custom Structures** â€“ When and how to roll your own for niche use cases

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Concept | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| **Hash maps** | Store instrument metadata, signals, position states |
| **Heaps / priority queues** | Schedule trades, implement order books, track min/max |
| **Queues / stacks** | Event handling and backtest state machines |
| **Graphs** | Model dependencies, strategy transitions, market structure |
| **Segment trees / BITs** | Real-time range queries in high-frequency scenarios |
| **Tries** | Fast lookup for tickers, command parsing in strategy DSLs |

---

## Hands-On Projects

- Implement a custom backtesting event queue using a priority heap
- Build a graph-based strategy router with weighted edges
- Optimize order book data processing with hash maps and sorted lists
- Create a trie for fast ticker autocomplete
- Reimplement standard structures in Python or C++ from scratch

---

## Assessment

- Implement 10â€“20 core structures from scratch (linked list, stack, map, etc.)
- Analyze time and space complexity of all operations
- Pass a LeetCode-style challenge on each data structure
- Build a real use-case structure (e.g., price interval tree or LRU cache)
