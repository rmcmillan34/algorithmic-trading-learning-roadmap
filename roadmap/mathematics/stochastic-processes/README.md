# Stochastic Processes

Stochastic processes provide a mathematical framework for modeling systems that evolve with uncertainty over time. In algorithmic trading, they are used to model asset price movements, interest rates, and market dynamics. Understanding stochastic processes is essential for creating robust trading algorithms, evaluating risks, and pricing derivatives.
