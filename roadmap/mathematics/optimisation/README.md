# Optimization

Optimization is a foundational mathematical discipline for algorithmic trading. It enables traders and quants to create efficient portfolios, fine-tune models, and maximize returns while minimizing risks. Understanding optimization principles is essential for tasks such as portfolio allocation, hyperparameter tuning, and strategy refinement.
