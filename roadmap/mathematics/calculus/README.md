# Calculus

Calculus is a cornerstone of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. It enables the modeling of dynamic systems, optimization of trading algorithms, and calculation of rates of change, such as price movement or portfolio value. From basic differentiation to advanced multivariable calculus, these concepts are essential for understanding and improving trading strategies.
