# Calculus

## Overview

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It provides tools for modeling dynamic systems and understanding rates of change — key concepts in fields ranging from physics and engineering to machine learning and finance. In the context of algorithmic trading, calculus underpins everything from stochastic calculus in option pricing, to gradient descent in machine learning, to interpreting integrals of price movement over time.

This topic covers both **single-variable** and **multivariable calculus**, as both are foundational for algorithmic trading systems.
