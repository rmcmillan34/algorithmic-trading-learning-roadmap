# Game Theory

Game theory is the study of strategic interactions where the outcome for each participant depends on the actions of others. It is a powerful tool in finance and algorithmic trading for modeling competitive and cooperative behaviors, such as auctions, market-making, and arbitrage. Understanding game theory equips traders with strategies to navigate competitive markets effectively.
