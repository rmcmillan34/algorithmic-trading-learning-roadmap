# Information Theory

Information theory provides the mathematical framework for quantifying, transmitting, and processing information. In algorithmic trading, it plays a vital role in analyzing market signals, optimizing data processing, and identifying patterns in financial datasets. Concepts like entropy, mutual information, and noise filtering are essential for extracting meaningful insights from noisy market data.
