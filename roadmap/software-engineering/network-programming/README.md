# Network Programming

Network Programming focuses on creating software that communicates over computer networks. It’s an essential skill for building distributed trading systems, enabling real-time data exchange, and optimizing low-latency communication. From understanding sockets and protocols to asynchronous communication and WebSockets, mastering network programming will allow you to design scalable, efficient, and secure trading infrastructure.

## Why Network Programming is Important

1. **Real-Time Trading Systems**
   - Trading systems need to exchange data in real-time, requiring fast, reliable network communication.

2. **Distributed Systems**
   - Modern trading systems are distributed across multiple servers and data centers. Network programming skills are essential for ensuring these systems communicate effectively and securely.

3. **Low-Latency Communication**
   - In algorithmic trading, even microseconds matter. Network programming helps optimize communication paths to reduce latency and improve execution speeds.

4. **Interfacing with APIs and Market Data Feeds**
   - Trading platforms often interact with external APIs and market data providers. Understanding network protocols and communication mechanisms is crucial for building robust integrations.
