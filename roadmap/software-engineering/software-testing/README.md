# Software Testing

## Overview

Software testing is the systematic evaluation of software to identify defects, ensure quality, and verify that a system meets its specified requirements. It encompasses a wide range of techniques‚Äîfrom manual test case execution to automated testing frameworks‚Äîand plays a vital role in maintaining software reliability, performance, and security.
