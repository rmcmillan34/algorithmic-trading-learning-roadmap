# Refactoring

## Overview

Refactoring is the process of improving the structure, readability, and maintainability of code‚Äîwithout changing its external behavior. It's a crucial skill in professional software engineering, enabling developers to clean up code, reduce duplication, simplify logic, and enhance architecture while ensuring existing functionality remains intact.

## Status: üü¢ Mandatory

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Every developer working in a production codebase |
| ‚úÖ Anyone responsible for bug fixing, feature extension, or code review |
| ‚úÖ Strongly recommended for algorithmic trading engineers modifying high-risk systems |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand when and why to refactor
- Use small, safe steps to restructure code while preserving behavior
- Identify common ‚Äúcode smells‚Äù and appropriate refactorings
- Apply refactoring patterns: extract method, introduce parameter, replace conditional, etc.
- Utilize IDE support or scripts for safe, automated refactors
- Prepare code for testability, modularity, or design pattern usage

---

## Key Concepts

- **Code Smells** ‚Äì Indicators of potential issues in code design (e.g., long methods, duplicated code)
- **Behavior Preservation** ‚Äì Ensuring refactoring doesn't alter what the code does
- **Micro-refactors** ‚Äì Small changes that reduce risk (e.g., renaming a variable)
- **Test-Covered Refactoring** ‚Äì Using automated tests to detect regressions
- **Refactoring Catalogs** ‚Äì Collections of common transformations used across languages
- **Continuous Refactoring** ‚Äì Ongoing improvement of code during development

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Scenario | Refactor |
|----------|----------|
| Long function with multiple responsibilities | Extract method and introduce intermediate abstractions |
| Strategy logic mixed with data I/O | Separate concerns into modules (e.g., data, logic, risk, logging) |
| Poorly tested signal code | Wrap legacy logic in test harness before changing |
| Repeated validation / logging logic | Replace duplication with decorators or utility modules |
| Unclear naming or magic constants | Rename and extract named config parameters for clarity |

---

## Hands-On Projects

- Refactor a function longer than 30 lines using ‚Äúextract method‚Äù and ‚Äúrename variable‚Äù
- Write tests around a module before performing a structural change
- Refactor an `if`/`else` ladder into a dictionary, polymorphism, or pattern match
- Apply 5 refactorings from Refactoring Guru to a hobby project
- Replace a conditional block with the Strategy or State pattern

---

## Assessment

- Can you identify at least 5 code smells in a codebase?
- Can you apply 5‚Äì10 refactorings without changing behavior?
- Do you refactor continuously (e.g., rename, extract, restructure) while building features?
- Can you prepare code for modularity, testing, or architecture improvements?

## Next Steps

- [Clean Code](../clean-code/) ‚Äì Write code that reduces future refactoring needs
- [Design Patterns](../design-patterns/) ‚Äì Use standard structures to replace ad hoc logic
- [Legacy Code](../legacy-code/) ‚Äì Refactor brittle or tightly coupled systems
- [Software Testing](../software-testing/) ‚Äì Use tests to support and validate changes
