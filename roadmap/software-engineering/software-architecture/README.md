# Software Architecture

## Overview

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a system, including its components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. Good architecture balances competing concerns: performance, scalability, security, modularity, and maintainability ‚Äî all while satisfying stakeholder requirements.

This topic helps you think beyond the code level to plan how systems grow, integrate, and evolve over time. You‚Äôll learn patterns, principles, and tradeoffs that influence successful software at scale.

## Status: üü¢ Mandatory

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Developers building medium to large applications |
| ‚úÖ Anyone designing services, APIs, or distributed systems |
| ‚úÖ Architects, team leads, or system designers |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand core responsibilities of a software architect
- Identify architectural quality attributes (e.g., availability, modifiability)
- Use architecture patterns (layered, microservices, event-driven, etc.)
- Apply principles like separation of concerns, cohesion, and encapsulation
- Create and interpret architecture diagrams (C4, UML, sequence, component)
- Analyze architectural tradeoffs using design tactics and scenarios

---

## Key Concepts

- **Architecture vs Design** ‚Äì Architecture defines structure; design implements it
- **Modularity** ‚Äì Decoupling systems into maintainable components
- **Architectural Views** ‚Äì Logical, physical, process, and development views
- **Tactics and Tradeoffs** ‚Äì Improve one quality (e.g., scalability) without harming others
- **Architecture Documentation** ‚Äì Views, decisions (ADRs), and diagrams
- **Component Interfaces** ‚Äì Define how modules communicate safely
- **Patterns** ‚Äì Microservices, monoliths, SOA, hexagonal, clean architecture
- **C4 Model** ‚Äì A visual hierarchy: context ‚Üí container ‚Üí component ‚Üí code
