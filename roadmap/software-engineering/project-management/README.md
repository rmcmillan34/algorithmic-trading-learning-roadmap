# Project Management

## Overview

Project management in software engineering involves translating goals into deliverables‚Äîon time, with quality, and aligned with user or business needs. This encompasses planning, estimating, coordinating tasks, managing workflows, and adapting to change.

While dedicated project managers often handle this at scale, every engineer benefits from understanding how to manage their own tasks, estimate realistically, and collaborate effectively using modern workflows like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

## Status: üü° Recommended

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Developers working with teams or clients |
| ‚úÖ Anyone shipping medium to large software systems |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for short personal projects, but valuable even for solo workflows |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Agile, Scrum, and Kanban workflows and when to apply them
- Break large goals into milestones, user stories, and actionable tasks
- Estimate time and complexity using techniques like story points or t-shirt sizing
- Track work using tools like Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects, or Notion
- Run sprints, standups, retrospectives, and planning meetings
- Utilize burndown charts, velocity tracking, and roadmap planning effectively

## Key Concepts

- **Agile** ‚Äì Iterative, feedback-driven development model
- **Scrum** ‚Äì Agile framework with sprints, standups, retrospectives, and roles
- **Kanban** ‚Äì Visual task management using ‚Äúpull‚Äù mechanics and WIP limits
- **Waterfall** ‚Äì Sequential planning model (useful in regulated or fixed environments)
- **User Stories** ‚Äì Tasks written from the user‚Äôs perspective with acceptance criteria
- **Estimation** ‚Äì Time, complexity, or value-based prediction techniques
