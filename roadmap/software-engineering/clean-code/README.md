# Clean Code

## Overview

Clean code is code that is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to change. It minimizes cognitive overhead for future readers â€” including your future self â€” and lays the groundwork for long-term maintainability, collaboration, and system resilience.

Writing clean code is a **core discipline** in professional software engineering. It complements testing, architecture, and refactoring by ensuring that every line of code expresses intent clearly and avoids hidden complexity.

## Status: ðŸŸ¢ Mandatory

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| âœ… Every developer â€” regardless of tech stack |
| âœ… Especially important in collaborative, long-lived projects |
| âœ… Core to code review culture, onboarding, and maintainability |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of clean code and code smell detection
- Improve naming, structure, and formatting for clarity
- Reduce duplication and complexity through composition and abstraction
- Write expressive functions, modules, and classes
- Follow idioms and conventions in your chosen language(s)
- Prepare code for easy testing, refactoring, and scaling

---

## Key Concepts

- **Naming** â€“ Use meaningful, unambiguous names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Functions** â€“ Keep them small, do one thing, use clear parameters
- **Comments** â€“ Prefer self-documenting code over inline explanations
- **Code Smells** â€“ Detect signs of poor structure (e.g., long methods, magic numbers, deep nesting)
- **DRY Principle** â€“ Donâ€™t repeat yourself
- **SOLID Principles** â€“ Foundation of OOP design cleanliness
- **Formatting & Style** â€“ Consistent indentation, spacing, structure
- **Cohesion and Coupling** â€“ Write focused modules with minimal interdependencies
- **Defensive Coding** â€“ Avoid nulls, unclear return types, silent failures

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Concept | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Function clarity** | Strategy logic is easier to test, audit, and explain |
| **Naming** | Improves interpretability when reading complex financial pipelines |
| **Small modules** | Enables plug-and-play architecture for signal, risk, and execution logic |
| **Testability** | Clean code naturally integrates with testing frameworks for high confidence |
| **Refactorability** | Simplifies adapting strategies to new markets, APIs, or risk models |

---

## Hands-On Practice

- Rewrite a past script with clearer names, smaller functions, and comments removed
- Refactor a function with 5+ parameters into a config object
- Identify code smells in a small repo (e.g., long method, shotgun surgery, feature envy)
- Perform a peer review on code using a "clean code" checklist
- Rewrite a CLI tool using principles from Clean Code and SOLID

---

## Assessment

- Complete a Clean Code checklist for one of your own projects
- Refactor a messy open-source function using clean code principles
- Follow a code style guide (e.g., PEP8, Google Style Guide) and apply formatting tools
- Explain the intent of any function/module in your codebase in one sentence
