# Software Engineering

## Overview

Software Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, testing, and maintaining reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems. This domain covers the real-world skills needed to move from writing small scripts to engineering complex, long-lived systems — with processes that scale across teams and time.

Whether you're a solo developer, startup engineer, or building an algorithmic trading platform from scratch, this domain will help you write better software that is **correct, clear, testable, secure, and built to last**.

## Guidance on Study Resources

While not all topics listed here have full university courses available, **each is supported by**:

- Classic books
- Online guides or open course notes
- GitHub repositories or coding practice
- Videos, blog posts, or paid courses (where relevant)

Each subfolder provides curated resources and guidance on how to self-study the topic at your own pace, including a breakdown of its relevance to algorithmic trading or software system design.

## Integration with Other Domains

Software Engineering bridges and supports multiple areas of this roadmap:

- For building infrastructure and automating deployments: see [`cloud-devops/`](../cloud-devops/)
- For code performance and correctness: see [`computer-science/`](../computer-science/) — especially Algorithms, Data Structures, and Concurrency
- For secure development practices: see [`general-skills/security/`](../general-skills/security/)
- For UI/UX, full-stack workflows, and APIs: see [`web-development/`](./web-development/) and [`project-management/`](./project-management/)
- For automating and validating production workflows: see [`version-control/`](./version-control/) and [`software-testing/`](./software-testing/)

> ✍️ **Goal**: Move beyond just solving problems — build software systems that are maintainable, testable, and usable in production environments with real-world constraints.
