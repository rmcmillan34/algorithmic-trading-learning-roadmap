# Requirements Engineering

## Overview

Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of discovering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints of a software system. It ensures that what you build matches what users and stakeholders truly need ‚Äî before a single line of code is written.

RE bridges the communication gap between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, providing a shared understanding of goals, scope, and success criteria.

## Status: üü° Recommended

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Developers writing specs, features, or roadmap docs |
| ‚úÖ Product managers, architects, and consultants |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for small solo projects, but highly valuable for team-based systems |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the phases of requirements engineering: elicitation, analysis, specification, validation
- Identify and categorize functional vs non-functional requirements
- Use techniques like use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria
- Model behavior using diagrams (e.g., state machines, sequence, or activity diagrams)
- Validate requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility
- Understand the impact of poorly defined or changing requirements

---

## Key Concepts

- **Requirements Elicitation** ‚Äì Interviews, workshops, observation, questionnaires
- **Functional Requirements** ‚Äì What the system should do (features, inputs/outputs)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** ‚Äì Constraints (e.g., performance, scalability, usability)
- **User Stories vs Use Cases** ‚Äì Agile vs structured requirement formats
- **Acceptance Criteria** ‚Äì How to test whether a requirement is met
- **Requirements Specification** ‚Äì Documented, structured format for all requirements
- **Requirements Validation** ‚Äì Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and testable
- **Requirements Traceability** ‚Äì Linking features, tests, and code to specific requirements

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Concept | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Functional Requirements** | Define behavior for strategy modules, risk checks, order management |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | Capture latency thresholds, throughput, availability, auditability |
| **User Stories** | Define trader or quant workflows with acceptance criteria |
| **Traceability** | Link requirements to test suites, metrics dashboards, and compliance reports |
| **Validation** | Ensure regulatory or performance criteria are explicitly captured and testable |

---

## Hands-On Projects

- üõ†Ô∏è Interview yourself or a colleague as a stakeholder and write 5 functional and 5 non-functional requirements
- üõ†Ô∏è Write user stories with acceptance criteria for a new trading bot or strategy
- üõ†Ô∏è Create a use case diagram and one sequence diagram for a trade flow
- üõ†Ô∏è Create a requirements traceability matrix for a small project
- üõ†Ô∏è Perform a validation review: are all your requirements complete, consistent, and testable?

---

## Assessment

- ‚úÖ Can you define functional and non-functional requirements for any project?
- ‚úÖ Have you written and validated user stories or formal specs?
- ‚úÖ Do you gather and document requirements before implementation?
- ‚úÖ Can you trace a requirement from documentation to code to test?

## Next Steps

- [Project Management](../project-management/) ‚Äì Break requirements into tasks, prioritize, and schedule
- [Software Architecture](../software-architecture/) ‚Äì Translate requirements into modular design
- [Software Testing](../software-testing/) ‚Äì Create tests based on requirement specs and criteria
- [Documentation](../documentation/) ‚Äì Capture, share, and validate stakeholder requirements
