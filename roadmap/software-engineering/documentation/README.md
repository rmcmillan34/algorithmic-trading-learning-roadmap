# Software Documentation

## Overview

Documentation is essential for making your software understandable, maintainable, and usable ‚Äî by others and by your future self. Whether it‚Äôs onboarding contributors, explaining APIs, or documenting architectural decisions, good documentation turns working code into a professional product.

This topic focuses on **developer-facing documentation**: READMEs, API references, inline comments, architecture diagrams, changelogs, and decision records.

## Status: üü° Recommended

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Anyone contributing to team projects or open source |
| ‚úÖ Developers building internal platforms or client-facing APIs |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Not mandatory for solo scripts or prototypes, but still valuable |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Write effective README files that describe purpose, setup, usage, and contribution
- Document public APIs clearly and consistently
- Use tools to auto-generate docs from code (docstrings ‚Üí HTML/PDF)
- Maintain living documentation using markdown, wikis, or static site generators
- Capture design and architecture decisions in ADRs
- Understand the balance between code comments and external docs

---

## Key Concepts

- **README.md** ‚Äì First impression of your project; goal, setup, usage, links
- **Code Comments vs Docstrings** ‚Äì Explain *why*, not *what*, in comments
- **API Documentation** ‚Äì OpenAPI/Swagger, RESTful conventions, JSDoc, Sphinx
- **Changelogs / Release Notes** ‚Äì Communicate updates clearly
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** ‚Äì Track significant technical choices
- **Internal vs External Docs** ‚Äì Split writing by audience and level of detail
- **Docs-as-Code** ‚Äì Use Git, markdown, linters, and PR reviews for docs

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Concept | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **ADRs** | Capture design decisions like backtest engine structure or signal modularity |
| **Changelogs** | Track changes to strategies, signals, or risk systems |
| **API Docs** | Provide clear specs for data ingestion, broker APIs, or strategy interfaces |
| **README quality** | Accelerate onboarding for collaborators or reviewers |
| **Auto-generated docs** | Maintain documentation parity as code evolves |

---

## Hands-On Projects

- Write a full `README.md` for one of your scripts or repos (include setup, usage, license, links)
- Create an ADR for a past technical decision you made
- Build an OpenAPI spec for a mock strategy or data API
- Set up MkDocs or Docusaurus for an internal tool
- Rewrite a long comment block into a proper explanation doc

---

## Assessment

- Your `README.md` answers: what, why, how, and who?
- You have auto-generated or manually written API docs
- You maintain docs alongside code with version control
- You use visual tools (Mermaid, UML) where appropriate
