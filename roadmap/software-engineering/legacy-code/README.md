# Legacy Code

## Overview

Legacy code isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúold code‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs code that is difficult to understand, change, or extend with confidence. It may lack tests, documentation, modularity, or conformity to modern design principles. Often, this kind of code is mission-critical and high-risk to touch ‚Äî especially in finance, infrastructure, and long-running systems.

This topic equips you with tools, techniques, and philosophies to work with legacy systems safely, incrementally modernizing them without breaking existing functionality.

## Status: üü£ Optional / Role-Specific

| Who should learn this? |
|-------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Engineers working in large codebases or long-lived systems |
| ‚úÖ Consultants, maintainers, or developers inheriting technical debt |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for early-stage projects or greenfield developers |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what makes code ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù (hint: it‚Äôs not just age)
- Learn techniques to read and comprehend unfamiliar codebases
- Gain strategies for safely modifying tightly-coupled or poorly tested code
- Apply testing and refactoring techniques without breaking behavior
- Introduce modularization, dependency isolation, and interface layers incrementally

---

## Key Concepts

- **Legacy ‚â† Old** ‚Äì Code is legacy if it‚Äôs difficult to safely change
- **Characterizing Legacy Code** ‚Äì Lack of tests, comments, modularity, or understanding
- **The Legacy Code Dilemma** ‚Äì Need to change code you don‚Äôt fully understand
- **Cover and Modify** ‚Äì Use test harnesses to pin behavior before changes
- **The Seam Concept** ‚Äì Find boundaries where change is possible (function, module, or API level)
- **Sprout Class / Method** ‚Äì Add new behavior alongside old rather than inside it
- **Golden Master Testing** ‚Äì Snapshot outputs to detect behavior changes without understanding internals

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

| Concept | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Test harnessing** | Pin behavior of an old signal generator before replacing it |
| **Sprout method** | Add new risk models next to legacy implementations |
| **Seam insertion** | Insert abstraction layers without breaking production systems |
| **Golden master testing** | Validate consistent output for a legacy backtest engine |
| **Refactoring to patterns** | Extract reusable logic to build new strategies on top |

## Hands-On Projects

- Identify ‚Äúseams‚Äù in a legacy script or system to inject testability
- Write characterization tests for a function you don‚Äôt understand
- Replace magic constants with named config variables
- Apply the Strangler Fig pattern to rewrite one subsystem alongside the old
- Use dependency injection or wrappers to decouple a hard-coded component

---

## Assessment

- Can you make a change to legacy code without breaking behavior?
- Can you explain the purpose of a codebase you didn‚Äôt write?
- Can you test around something you can‚Äôt safely rewrite yet?
- Have you applied seams or sprouting to isolate change?

## Next Steps

- [Refactoring](../refactoring/) ‚Äì Safely improve code structure once behavior is understood
- [Software Testing](../software-testing/) ‚Äì Use tests to stabilize legacy systems before changes
- [Clean Code](../clean-code/) ‚Äì Prevent the next generation of legacy code
- [Software Architecture](../software-architecture/) ‚Äì Redesign boundaries for better modularity
