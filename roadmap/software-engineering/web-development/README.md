# Web Development

---

## Overview

Web development involves designing and building dynamic websites and interactive web applications. It encompasses both client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) development, spanning user interfaces, APIs, authentication, and performance tuning. For aspiring algorithmic traders, full-stack web skills are essential for:

- Building dashboards to monitor live trading strategies and portfolio performance  
- Exposing model results and strategy controls through APIs or interactive tools  
- Creating real-time web interfaces for signal distribution, data visualization, or backtest interaction  

Web development also serves as a foundation for cloud deployment, DevOps automation, and UI-driven decision support systems ‚Äî key layers in professional algorithmic trading pipelines.

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to learn both frontend and backend to be useful in trading?**  
A: No ‚Äî but fullstack skills allow you to build and deploy end-to-end tools, which is especially helpful if you‚Äôre solo building infrastructure.

**Q: Should I learn Django, Flask, or Node?**  
A: If you're already strong in Python, start with Flask. Node is better if you plan to integrate with modern JS-heavy stacks.

**Q: Will I need DevOps knowledge?**  
A: For deployment, yes ‚Äî see [DevOps & CI/CD](../../cloud-devops/) for the next logical step.
