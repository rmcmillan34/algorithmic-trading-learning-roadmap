# Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. It allows for the creation of reusable and modular code, making it easier to manage and maintain large software projects.

## Key Concepts
1. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on that data.
3. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.
4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism that allows a new class (child class) to inherit
    properties and methods from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows for methods to be defined in a parent class and overridden in child classes.
6. **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.
